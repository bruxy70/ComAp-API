    "# Authentication - API secrets\n",
    "To link the API to your account, and for security reasons, each API call needs to have two parameters: `ComAp-Key` and `Token`.  \n",
    "To get the ComAp-Key, login to https://portal.websupervisor.net/developer (using your WSV Pro login credentials). There are two keys available - Primary and Secondary - pick one of them - it does not matter which one.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(The idea is, that you use one of them in production, and the second for testig. After the testing, you can Regenerate the key, to make sure it stays secret. And this will not impact the other key that is used in production.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating token\n",
    "The `Token` is generated by calling API `Authenticate`. As part of this package, there is a script `get-token.py`, that will ask you for the `ComAp-Key`, your WSV username and password, generare the `Token` and store it in the config file. This script is called from the `setup.bat` script. But you can call it any time by running `python get-token` from the command line. \n",
    "Please do not share this configuration file, it contains your login information. \n",
    "The `Token` automatically expires after 1 month if it is not used. The `ComAp-Key` can be regenerated in case it gets leaked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing the API secrets \n",
    "The API key should not be hard-coded in the script. There are number of ways for storing the keys securely, that are beyond the scope of this document. For the purpose of this repository, we are storing the key in file `config.py`, with following content:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "KEY='<YOUR KEY GOES HERE>'\n",
    "TOKEN='<THE TOKEN GOES HERE>'\n",
    "```\n",
